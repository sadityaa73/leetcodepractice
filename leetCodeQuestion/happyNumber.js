// Write an algorithm to determine if a n n is happy.

// A happy n is a n defined by the following process:

// Starting with any positive integer, replace the n by the sum of the squares of its digits.
// Repeat the process until the n equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
// Those ns for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
// Return true if n is a happy n, and false if not.

//Example:
// Input: n = 19
// Output: true
// Explanation:
// 12 + 92 = 82
// 82 + 22 = 68
// 62 + 82 = 100
// 12 + 02 + 02 = 1

let input =19;
